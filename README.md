MOVIE TICKET BOOKING SYSTEM
  
  This is my very first coding project which I did in my high school.The aim was to built a movie ticket booking system and it turned out to be a fairly good attempt of replicating what sites like bookmyshow does.
  Basically, what the project simply does is that,it books tickets for different movies for a day and generates the bill for the same.It is entirely built in C++(my first programming language) and uses concepts of structures,file handling etc. It has a few limitations though,like it cannot handle multiple showtimings for a movie but passes well for a good project otherwise.Go check out the code.Hope it turns out to be useful.....:)
